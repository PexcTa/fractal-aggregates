# Fractal Aggregate Generator

A Python package for generating and analyzing fractal particle aggregates based on the Porous Eden Model described in Guesnet et al. (2019).

## Features
- Generate 3D fractal aggregates with tunable fractal dimension
- Calculate morphological properties (shape factor, radius of gyration, etc.)
- Visualize aggregates and their properties
- Batch processing and parameter sweeps

## Getting Started
1. Create conda environment: `conda create -n fractal_project python=3.10 -y`
2. Activate environment: `conda activate fractal_project`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
